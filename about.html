                <p>Federico is a 23-year-old Film and Fine Arts student from Italy, with the dream of working in the film industry.
                    His filmmaking experience began in his bedroom, making amateur stop-motion movies with lego and recreating movie
                    scenes with his siblings.</p>
                    <p>As he grew up, this passion became every time more powerful. At the age of 15,
                    he won a prize at the international short movie contest "Harambee conveying Africa",
                    and recently he has worked on a short film project with the Italian film company Lux Vide S.p.A. In 2018,
                    as a result of his previous promotional experience with school-work alternation, he was appointed by a
                    Pontificial University to make the promotional video of a seminar held at the Urbaniana University.</p>
                    <p>His leadership, management, and public relations skills were also put to the test with a music group project, 
                    Asini che Volano, where he assumed the role of the social media manager and general manager. He was constantly 
                    in search and in contact with music producers, studying new strategies for success</p>
